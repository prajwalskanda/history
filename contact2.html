    <p>Art is the mirror of culture. The stages of human development find the path of refinement through the emancipation of culture. Through art, this fine cultural expression sustains human spirit in all the ages — past, present and future. Thus, Indian
        art, thought, and literature have focused on the concept of unconscious to conscious through which the seeker aspires to attain bliss; in Indian understanding, it is atmananda (joy of the soul). From time to time, Indian philosophy has tried to
        link abstract concepts such as space in terms of existence, time in terms of experiencing bliss, and thought in terms of consciousness. Out of such philosophical thought emerged the idea of creating the image proper, concentrating in it all the
        abstract properties. In this process, the formless — a unique concept — has transformed itself into an embodiment of magnificent expression in the form of sculpture. In this way, sculpture or Shilpa is three-dimensional art expressing the concrete
        form of divine beings.</p>

    <p>From terracotta figurines of the Indus Valley, to the expressive stone and metal images of medieval times, Indian sculpture has evolved into a major art form with almost every century contributing fresh styles of expression. The puranic incarnations
        of Vishnu emerged as mighty figures in the Gupta period as a divine boar in the Udayagiri and Dashavatara caves at Ellora of Rashtrakuta times. Similarly, the abstract form of linga reveals itself in the anthropomorphic forms of Shiva, reaching
        the height of manifestation in Chalukya, Pallava, and Rashtrakuta art. The Maheshamurthi in the Elephanta caves represents the pinnacle of human creative expression wherein the human hand and touch could transform the formless into a divine form.
        The expression of spiritual qualities and the sense of attainment of salvation reached the height of idealization in the form of the Buddha and Tirthankara (one who has conquered samsara, the cycle of death and rebirth) images. The quality of
        Indian sculpture exists in the timeless being, simply at rest within its fullness, surrounded by silence. The essence of dance, music, spirituality, functional objectivity, and surrendering sublimate are faithfully rendered in the sculptural art
        of India. When we observe the sculptures and paintings created from pre-historic to contemporary times, it is evident that at any given point of time Indian art is expressed with higher emphasis on the depiction of female figures. The renowned
        art historian Stella Kramarisch is completely right in her opinion: “Indian art culminates in the representations of feminity”. The feminine form has caught the interest of artist and devotee alike, who never tire of creating or viewing the female
        form in all its manifestation.</p>
