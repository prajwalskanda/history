    <p>It all starts with the beautiful remains of a Buddhist stupa (image below), right at its entrance. The 2,200 year old yakshas and yakshis [nature spirits], devatas [gods], floral and animal motifs, and Buddha’s pre-birth [Jataka] stories wrap around
        its railings, cross bars and coping stones to bring to life the Indian Mauryan era, and a time when Buddha was still not depicted in human form. But this was soon to change. A change that was to take place in an art style which took birth in a
        rocky outcrop of land in north-west Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan 300 hundred years later. The second creative epoch alternatively known as the Gandhara, Graeco-Buddhist, or Graeco-Roman School, flourished during the Kushan dynasty and more
        specifically the rule of Kanishka the Great, a devout patron of Buddhism (2nd Century). Moulded by the region’s close ties with Rome, Buddha here appears not through indirect Jataka stories and obscure representation, but instead as a great enlightened
        man with a youthful Apollo-like face and dressed in Roman togas in gray-blue schist and stucco. Wavy hair, sometimes even moustached, and the presence of the urna (protuberance) between the eyebrows become the iconographic norm. The second creative

    <p>Whilst the Gandhara School was developing its own unique sculptural language, another art form was shaping itself, also under the Kushan dynasty, somewhere in the heart of the Indian peninsula in a trading and pilgrimage centre called Mathura. A style
        more indigenous and rooted in ‘Indian’ artistic traditions, Mathura was an exporter of sculpture to much of north central India. Taking inspiration from the depiction of native yakshas and yakshis, Mathura’s artists imbued the local red mottled
        sandstone with sensual life. The school was characterised with broad-shouldered, round-faced, short flat spiral haired Buddhas brimming with enormous energy, and an uṣṇiṣa [protuberance] on the top of the head—It was a representation that would
        later become the global standard in the Buddhist world. The female figures were equally ‘alive’. Nude or semi-nude voluptuous women carved in high relief, they epitomised fertility and abundance.Known for its magnificent reliefs in white marble
        and limestone, the carvings are among the world’s finest examples of narrative sculpture. The most exceptional of these reliefs were carved on the panels surrounding the Amaravati stupa (2nd Century), one of the largest stupas built in Buddhist
        India [50 metres in diameter and 30 metres high]. Much of the stupa has been destroyed. However, remnants of the decorative plaques bring alive Buddha’s life and Jataka stories through crowded yet unified compositions filled with dynamic movement,
        using both aniconic and iconic representations of the Buddha.
